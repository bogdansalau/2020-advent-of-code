/**
 * You start on the open square (.) in the top-left corner and need to reach the bottom (below the bottom-most row on your map).
 * The toboggan can only follow a few specific slopes (you opted for a cheaper model that prefers rational numbers);
 * start by counting all the trees you would encounter for the slope right 3, down 1:
 * From your starting position at the top-left, check the position that is right 3 and down 1. Then, check the position that is right 3 and down 1 from there, and so on until you go past the bottom of the map.
 * The locations you'd check in the above example are marked here with O where there was an open square and X where there was a tree:
 *
 * ..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  --->
 * #..O#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..
 * .#....X..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.
 * ..#.#...#O#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#
 * .#...##..#..X...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.
 * ..#.##.......#.X#.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  --->
 * .#.#.#....#.#.#.#.O..#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#
 * .#........#.#........X.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#
 * #.##...#...#.##...#...#.X#...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...
 * #...##....##...##....##...#X....##...##....##...##....##...##....#
 * .#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...X.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  --->
 * In this example, traversing the map using this slope would cause you to encounter 7 trees.
 *
 * Starting at the top-left corner of your map and following a slope of right 3 and down 1, how many trees would you encounter?
